# Demo - ryftrest - May 12, 2015

Support for JSON format, updated ryftrest tool and query decomposition.

Query decomposition now combines a few subqueries of the same type to minimize Ryft H/W calls:

`(RECORD CONTAINS DATE(...)) AND (RECORD CONTAINS DATE(...)) AND (RECORD CONTAINS "sometext")`

will be translated to just two calls:

- `(RECORD CONTAINS DATE(...)) AND (RECORD CONTAINS DATE(...))`
- `(RECORD CONTAINS "sometext")`

because first two subqueries have the same date search type.


## Updated ryftrest tool

To minimize tool output new `--count` option is now supported.
Passing this flag makes the tool use `/count` endpoint instead of `/search`.
Only the search statistics will be printed, no any records.

```{.sh}
ryftrest -q '(RECORD.id CONTAINS "100310")' -f '*.pcrime' --local --format=xml --fields=ID,Date --count
```

Debian package places the ryftrest tool at `/usr/bin/` directory.

### Advanced processing

Alternative option to minimize ryftrest tool output
is to use `jq` command line JSON processor:

```{.sh}
ryftrest -q '(RECORD.id CONTAINS "100310")' -f '*.pcrime' --local --format=xml --fields=ID,Date | jq ".stats"
```

This command is almost equal to the previous one.

Note, without `--count` option all data is still transferred.
All processing is done on the client side.

Using `jq` it's possible to do advanced data processing:

```{.sh}
ryftrest -q '(RECORD.id CONTAINS "100310")' -f '*.pcrime' --local --format=xml --fields=ID,Date | jq ".results[].Date"
```

This command will print list of date strings.


## Preserve search results

By default all search results are deleted from the Ryft server once they are delivered to user.
But to have "search in the previous results" feature there are two query parameters: `data=` and `index=`.

First `data=output.dat` parameter keeps the search results on the Ryft server under `/ryftone/output.dat`.
It is possible to use that file as an input for the subsequent search call `files=output.dat`.

Note, it is important to use consistent file extension for the structured search
in order to let Ryft use appropriate RDF scheme!

Second `index=index.txt` parameter keeps the search index under `/ryftone/index.txt`.

```{.sh}
ryftrest -q '(RECORD.id CONTAINS "100310")' -f '*.pcrime' --local --format=xml --fields=ID,Date -od="mytest.pcrime" -oi="mytest.txt"
cat /ryftone/mytest.txt
```

These `data=` and `index=` query parameters are supported by the both `/search` and `/count` endpoints.

In case of complex search expression query decomposition saves data and index of the top subquery.

For now there is no way to delete such intermediate result file.
At least until `DELETE /files` API endpoint will be implemented.

Warning, if data or index file with the same name already exists it will be overriden!
It's potential security hole - a way to delete any file in /ryftone.
Perhaps we shouldn't allow file replacement, specially when `DELETE /files`
will be implemented with some kind of authorization.


## JSON format support

If input file set contains JSON data, the found records could be decoded. Just pass `format=json` query parameter.

```{.sh}
ryftrest -q '(RECORD.Name CONTAINS "Bruce")' -f 'CitizensOfGotham.json' --local --format=json
```

output:

```{.json}
{"results":[{"Actors":[{"Name":"Adam West"},{"Name":"Michael Keaton"},{"Name":"Val Kilmer"},{"Name":"George Clooney"},{"Name":"Christian Bale"}],"AlterEgo":"The Batman","Name":"Bruce Wayne","_index":{"file":"/CitizensOfGotham.json","offset":8,"length":1108,"fuzziness":0,"host":"ryftone-310"}}
,{"Actors":[{"Name":"Adam West"},{"Name":"Michael Keaton"},{"Name":"Val Kilmer"},{"Name":"George Clooney"},{"Name":"Christian Bale"}],"AlterEgo":"The Batman","Name":"Bruce Wayne","_index":{"file":"/CitizensOfGotham.json","offset":5688,"length":1108,"fuzziness":0,"host":"ryftone-310"}}
,{"Actors":[{"Name":"Adam West"},{"Name":"Michael Keaton"},{"Name":"Val Kilmer"},{"Name":"George Clooney"},{"Name":"Christian Bale"}],"AlterEgo":"The Batman","Name":"Bruce Wayne","_index":{"file":"/CitizensOfGotham.json","offset":11368,"length":1108,"fuzziness":0,"host":"ryftone-310"}}
],"stats":{"matches":3,"totalBytes":17040,"duration":652,"dataRate":0.024924249005463955,"fabricDataRate":0}
```

Moreover, to minimize output or to get just subset of fields the `fields=` query parameter could be used.
For example to get `AlterEgo` and `Name` fields from a `CitizensOfGotham.json` file pass `format=json&fields=AlterEgo,Name`.

```{.sh}
ryftrest -q '(RECORD.Name CONTAINS "Bruce")' -f 'CitizensOfGotham.json' --local --format=json --fields=AlterEgo,Name
```

output:

```{.json}
{"results":[{"AlterEgo":"The Batman","Name":"Bruce Wayne","_index":{"file":"/CitizensOfGotham.json","offset":8,"length":1108,"fuzziness":0,"host":"ryftone-310"}}
,{"AlterEgo":"The Batman","Name":"Bruce Wayne","_index":{"file":"/CitizensOfGotham.json","offset":5688,"length":1108,"fuzziness":0,"host":"ryftone-310"}}
,{"AlterEgo":"The Batman","Name":"Bruce Wayne","_index":{"file":"/CitizensOfGotham.json","offset":11368,"length":1108,"fuzziness":0,"host":"ryftone-310"}}
],"stats":{"matches":3,"totalBytes":17040,"duration":734,"dataRate":0.02213979611929496,"fabricDataRate":0}
```

Note, JSON format (just like XML) could be used with structured search only!


## Points to discuss

### Numeric search

Numeric search is implemented in the same way date and time search was implemented.  It will be tested when the hardware or VM is available with the numberic search feature.
